# Getting Started

Welcome to Bantai! This guide will help you get up and running with Bantai, a type-safe policy evaluation library for building complex validation and decision-making logic.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn how to:

- **Install Bantai** and its dependencies in your project
- **Create your first policy** with contexts, rules, and evaluation
- **Understand core concepts** like type safety, evaluation strategies, and hooks
- **Build real-world solutions** using Bantai's composable architecture

## Quick Overview

Bantai follows a simple five-phase workflow:

1. **Define Context** - Create type-safe schemas using Zod
2. **Craft Rules** - Write validation logic that returns `allow()` or `deny()`
3. **Compose Policies** - Group rules with evaluation strategies
4. **Execute Evaluation** - Get instant decisions with detailed results
5. **Handle Results** - Use decisions and violations to power your app
